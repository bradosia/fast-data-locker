# Fast Data Locker

A fast and convenient data lock system. Data locker encrypts sensitive files and folders.
This tool is different than others because of its autolock feature that locks files and folders after a time delay. 
This tool was developed for windows systems.

This tool was designed to protect against laptop swipers that could steal your laptop at any time and have access to your your personal photos, financial data, and passwords that were stored on your laptop. The specific type of theft this tool is meant to protect against are as follows:

> You are in a coffee shop viewing your quickbooks file on your computer, when suddenly a thief swipes the laptop from your hands and jumps into a get away vehicle before you can catch them. The thief hands the laptop to a black market reseller. A buyer buys your black market laptop and finds your photos and financials.

> You store your laptop in your trunk while parked at a supermarket. A thief randomly targets your car for a break-in and steals your laptop. The thief hands the laptop to a black market reseller. A buyer buys your black market laptop and finds your photos and financials.

> You are in a library using your laptop, but you need to use the restroom. You ask the person beside you to watch your stuff while you are gone. When you return, you discover that person and your laptop are gone. The thief tells her son that they bought the laptop used and the owner never removed the password. The son downloads a password cracking device and unlocks the laptop for his parents. The person now has access to your photos and financials.

You may think your computer password will keep them out, but a savvy thief can easily access your data without needing your computer password by the following methods:

> Remove your laptop hard drive and use it as an external drive to bypass the password and view your files 

> Use the many cracking tools available on the web.

This tool combats each situation, by automatically locking your important files after a certain time period customizable by the user. Here are the theft situations above that are mitigated with the autolock feature:

> You are in a coffee shop viewing your quickbooks file on your computer, when suddenly a thief swipes the laptop from your hands and jumps into a get away vehicle before you can catch them. The thief hands the laptop to a black market reseller. A buyer buys your black market laptop and upon opening your laptop, the sensitive files are auto-encrypted.

> You store your laptop in your trunk while parked at a supermarket. A thief randomly targets your car for a break-in and steals your laptop. The thief hands the laptop to a black market reseller. A buyer buys your black market laptop and upon opening your laptop, the sensitive files are auto-encrypted.

> You are in a library using your laptop, but you need to use the restroom. You ask the person beside you to watch your stuff while you are gone. When you return, you discover that person and your laptop are gone. The thief tells her son that they bought the laptop used and the owner never removed the password. The son downloads a password cracking device and unlocks the laptop for his parents.  Upon opening your laptop, the sensitive files are auto-encrypted.

This tool won't work if your laptop is turned off immedietely after being stolen and the hard drive is removed, because this won't give the laptop and chance to auto-encrypt the files. However, a thief normally won't think of first removing the hard drive. The thief will first open your laptop and see if you have a password set. This will allow the auto-encrypt program to run.
