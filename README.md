# Fast Data Locker

A fast and convenient data lock system. Data locker encrypts sensitive files and folders.
This tool is different than others because of its autolock feature that locks files and folders after a time delay. 
This tool was developed for windows systems.

This tool was designed to protect against laptop swipers that could steal your laptop at any time and have access to your images of your photos, financial data, and passwords that were stored on your laptop. The specific type of theft this tool is meant to protect against are as follows:

> You are in a coffee shop viewing your quickbooks file on your computer, when suddenly a thief swipes the laptop from your hands and jumps into a get away vehicle before you can catch them.

> You store your laptop in your trunk while parked at a supermarket. A thief randomly targets your car for a break-in and steals your laptop.

> You are in a library using your laptop, but you need to use the restroom. You ask the person beside you to watch your stuff while you are gone. When you return, you discover that person and your laptop are gone.

You may think your computer password will keep them out, but a savvy thief can easily access your data without needing your computer password by the following methods:
> remove your laptop hard drive and use it as an external drive to bypass the password and view your files 
> use the many cracking tools available on the web.

This tool combats this situation, by automatically locking your important files after a certain time period customizable by the user. For example, the user might specify the relock time to be 6 hours.
